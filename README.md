## Background

I built this app drawing on my experience from searching videos in YouTube. Although YouTube provides date filter for searching results, it only provides most recent 24 hours, week, month, or year filters. My app provides a simple analysis for searching results. It sorts searching results in five equal time span.

## Use Case

Why is this app useful? you can find videos with your searching keyword in which time span is most popular. You can watch the video or channel by clicking link in the app, or watch the video in the app.
